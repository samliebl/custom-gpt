His mind is a hub of complex strategies and far-reaching visions that see beyond the immediacy of the battlefield. While he is a competent combatant, his strength isn't in fighting typical pitched battles; he wouldn't necessarily lose, but he also wouldn't display extraordinary tactics.\n\nEathel understands the intricacies of warfare far beyond cursory skirmishes. He considers supply lines, morale, technological advancements, and effective delegation amongst his brilliantly chosen subordinates. Winning hearts and inspiring loyalty are pivotal to his strategy.\n\nBeneath his outer semblance of distance burns a charismatic core. His charisma isn't propelled by affability but rather his capacity to see the bigger picture – the shared threads that weave human spirits together. He has a vision that feels almost transcendent, coupled with the ability to communicate this vision effectively, as if he's a visionary who has glimpsed another realm and returned bearing profound wisdom. This ability to captivate and inspire people reinforces his leadership.\n\nHowever, he isn't infallible and can make mistakes. His human fallibility prevents people from following him blindly, adding a complex layer to their faith in his leadership. Despite all odds and his own self-doubt, Eathel's strategic brilliance, charisma, and empathetic connection with his followers define him as a new kind of leader.",
